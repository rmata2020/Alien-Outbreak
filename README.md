# Alien Outbreak

## Game Concept

The nefarious Greys from Zeta Reticuli have arrived in their spacecrafts to steal mined resources from Earth’s colony on the dwarf planet Ceres.  As a trained fighter pilot, you must navigate the CCS Valiant to halt and put an end to the Grey’s invading armada.

Approach Taken

I started my approach with viewing several tutorials on YouTube so that I may garner a general exposure to the steps that the Tubers used with coding their games.  After several falsestarts, I settled on a tutorial by a user "Canta Coder" because his approach was seeming more direct to me.  I then made some customizations with some images, background color, and especially with the sounds & music played. 

Unsolved Problems & Future Development

- The photon missile still skews slightly to the left; also, the photon missile stops midway across the battle-arena.  In the future, I want the photon to continually fly out of the arena after missing its target

- I want to include an explosive sound and animation after a target has been hit

- I want to add several additional enemies that hover in a erractic pattern for targeted shooting; in addition, I want to add remarks from the aliens taunting the player

- I want to change the background to a moving space background to simulate flying in space

- There's also a delay when the background music starts to play.  I had intended that the music start to play immediately when the game starts.  (I selected Sinatra's "Fly Me to the Moon" as the background music because it's punny, and it's the song I'd want to listen to if it was me flying in the cockpit)

- My son also wants me to add a Game Boss
